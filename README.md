Lab 1: Quadratic Equation Solver

Develop a Java program that prints all real solutions to the quadratic equation ax2+bx+c = 0. Read in a, b, c and use the quadratic formula. If the discriminate b2-4ac is negative, display a message stating that there are no real solutions.
Lab 2: Student Class with SGPA Calculation
Program Description: Create a class Student with attributes such as usn, name, an array of credits, and an array of marks. Implement methods to accept and display details and calculate the SGPA of a student.
Lab 3: Book Class with Object Creation
Program Description: Create a class Book with members like name, author, price, and num_pages. Develop a Java program to create n book objects, set their details, and display the complete information using a toString() method.
Lab 4: Shape Hierarchy with Abstract Class
Program Description: Develop an abstract class Shape with two integers and an empty method named printArea(). Provide three classes (Rectangle, Triangle, and Circle) that extend the Shape class, each containing the printArea() method to print the area of the respective shape.
Lab 5: Bank Account Management
Program Description: Create a class Bank with savings and current account types. Implement methods to perform various banking operations like deposit, withdrawal, interest computation, and handling minimum balance constraints.
Lab 6: Package and Class Organization
Program Description: Create packages CIE and SEE. CIE contains classes Student and Internals, while SEE has the class External derived from Student. Import the packages and declare the final marks of n students in all five courses.
Lab 7: Exception Handling in Inheritance
Program Description: Implement exception handling in an inheritance tree. Create a base class Father and a derived class Son that extends Father. Implement constructors with age-related exceptions.
Lab 8: Multithreading
Program Description: Create two threadsâ€”one displaying "BMS College of Engineering" every ten seconds and the other displaying "CSE" every two seconds.
Lab 9: User Interface with Exception Handling
Program Description: Create a user interface to perform integer divisions. Handle exceptions like NumberFormatException and ArithmeticException when the user enters invalid input or tries to divide by zero.
